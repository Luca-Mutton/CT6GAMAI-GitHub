This project uses the Unity engine to create an AI for a stealth based game. The AI in the game will operate by themselves using a 
finite state machine (FSM), so the AI will behave differently based on the behaviours set up. Alongside FSM, 
the AI will also be built using AI pathfinding and perceptions, utilising and merging these techniques for AI Character 
to respond in the game will be explored in the creation of the Artefact. I also tried to set up steering behaviours for the chase state however, 
it didn't work as intended but the code can still be seen within the project inside the AI_states script and the seek script.

Unity version: 2019.3.4f1

Controls:
W- Move up
A- Move Left
S- Move Down
D- Move right
